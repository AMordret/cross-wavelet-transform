## CODE for MEASURING SEISMIC TRAVEL-TIME CHANGES with the WAVELET METHOD
#### Contact: Shujuan Mao (maos@mit.edu) and Aur√©lien Mordret (aurelien.mordret@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr)

This package contains codes and test data for measuring seismic travel-time shifts in the time-frequency domain using the wavelet cross-spectrum analysis. 
## Requirements
All the files must be in the same folder when you launch the program

Python 3 and the PyCWT packages from https://github.com/regeirk/pycwt are needed to run the codes

You can use pip to install this package :

    $ pip install pycwt

## Contents in this package

* **cwt.py** <br/><br/>
  The core function to calculate dt in the time-frequency domain by wavelet cross-spectrum analysis.

* **plotting_example.py** <br/><br/>
  An example of using the cwt function on synthetic data. Plots come with one click.

* **ori_waveform.npy** <br/>
  **new_waveform.npy** <br/><br/>
  Two synthetic waveforms for testing the codes, ori_waveform and new_waveform <br/>
  The synthetic seismograms are generated using velocity models by a homogeneous background superimposed with random heterogeneities.<br/>
  The perturbation between the current and reference velocity models is a 0.05% homogeneous dv/v throughout the medium. (If interested, see Section 3.1 in the following reference for more details.)
    
* **time.npy**<br/>
  **fs.npy** <br/><br/>
  The time vector and sampling frequency associated with the synthetic waveforms
  

## Plotting Example

Using the cwt function and the synthetic data, we can perform a cross-wavelet transform. <br/>
This is the plot we obtain using the **plotting_example.py** program :
